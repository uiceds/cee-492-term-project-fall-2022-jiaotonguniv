### Title of the project

#### Bike-Share Usage in London Network Analysis

### Description

#### Dataset:

For this project, we are going to combine the data from two datasets. The first one is 'London and Taipei Bike-Share Data', and the second one is London bike sharing dataset. 

#### London and Taipei Bike-Share Data

The raw data is collected from the respective cities open data sites. 

[London](https://cycling.data.tfl.gov.uk/) 

[Taipei](https://data.taipei/#/dataset?topic=topic-transportation)

The data has been reformatted into CSV in order to be easier to use and compare. The content is unchanged. This gives the columns in the data comprise:

##### 1.rental_id -

##### 2.duration -

##### 3.bike_id -

##### 4.end_rental_date_time -

##### 5.end_station_id -

##### 6.end_station_name -

##### 7.start_rental_date_time -

##### 8.start_station_id -

##### 9.start_station_name -

#### London bike sharing dataset

This dataset runs from 4th January 2015 to 3rd January 2017 and reports total bike hire numbers for a bike rental scheme in London, England, alongside some weather info.

The data has been formatted into CSV in order to be easier to use and compare. This gives The columns in the data comprise:

##### 1.mestamp - timestamp field for grouping the data

##### 2.cnt- the count of a new bike shares

##### 3.t1 real temperature in C

##### 4.t2 - temperature in C "feels like"

##### 5.hum - humidity in percentage

##### 6.windspeed - wind speed in km/h

##### 7.weathercode - category of the weather

###### 1 = Clear ; mostly clear but have some values with haze/fog/patches of fog/ fog in vicinity

###### 2 = scattered clouds / few clouds

###### 3 = Broken clouds

###### 4 = Cloudy

###### 7 = Rain/ light Rain shower/ Light rain

###### 10 = rain with thunderstorm

###### 26 = snowfall

##### 8.isholiday - boolean field - 1 holiday / 0 non holiday - refers to bank holidays

##### 9.isweekend - boolean field - 1 if the day is weekend / 0 if a working day

##### 10.season - category (0-spring; 1-summer; 2-autumn; 3-winter)

In addition to season and isweekend, from the timestamp feature we can extract many separate time features - day of the week (as one scaled column or as seven columns of ismonday, istuesday etc.), month number, day of the month, week number, hour, minute. In combination with external data, we could add islight for after dawn times and is_schoolholiday to match London school holiday times.

### Proposal

Recently, bike-sharing in big cities has become an important part of residents' daily life, which plays a significant role in urban transportation system. The data is spatiotemporal, in other words, it varies over space and time. That variation can be explored, described, and modeled in many different ways. The overlap of two datasets shows many factors affecting residents' bike-renting behavior.

Previous work has shown that weather is a key driver for variation in usage. By utilizing those datasets to analyze the evidence for extreme weather events like winter rains in London, it is safe to draw some conclusions guiding the process of making contingency plans. The locations of start-trip and end-trip is also considered to have the potential of revealing hot spots of bike-renting usage.

The result will be able to offer some suggestions for the decision maker of bike-sharing companies about the arrangement of bike density in different blocks, methods to tackle extreme weather conditions and distribution between urban and rural areas.
